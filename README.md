# Docker ECR Cache

A [Buildkite plugin](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/plugins) to build and cache entire docker images in ECR.

This allows you to define a Dockerfile for your build-time dependencies without worrying about the time it
takes to build the image. It allows you to re-use entire docker images without worrying about layer caching, and/or pruning
layers as changes are made to your containers.

An ECR repository to store the built docker image will be created for you, if one doesn't already exist.

# Example

## Basic Usage

Dockerfile
```
FROM bash
RUN echo "my expensive build step"
```

```yml
steps:
  - command: 'echo wow'
    plugins:
      - seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v1.0.0
      - docker#v2.0.0
```

## Caching NPM Packages

This plugin can be used to effectively cache `node_modules` between builds without worrying abbout
docker layer cache invalidation. You do this by hinting when the image should be re-built.

Dockerfile
```
FROM node:8
WORKDIR /workdir
COPY package.json package-lock.json /workdir
# this step downloads the internet
RUN npm install
```

```yml
steps:
  - command: 'npm test'
    plugins:
      - seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v1.0.0:
          cache-on:
            - package-lock.json
      - docker#v2.0.0
```

## Using Another Dockerfile

It's possible to specify the Dockerfile to use by:

```yml
steps:
  - command: 'echo wow'
    plugins:
      - seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v1.0.0:
          dockerfile: my-dockerfile
      - docker#v2.0.0
```

## Specifying a target step

A [multi-stage Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) can be used to reduce an application container to just its runtime dependencies.
However, this stripped down container may not have the environment necessary for running CI commands such as tests or linting.
Instead, the `target` property can be used to specify an intermediate build stage to run commands against:

```yml
steps:
  - command: 'cargo test'
    plugins:
      - seek-oss/docker-ecr-cache#v1.0.0:
          target: build-deps
      - docker#v2.0.0
```

# Tests

To run the tests of this plugin, run
```sh
docker-compose run --rm tests
```
